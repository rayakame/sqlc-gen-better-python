A WASM plugin for SQLC allowing the generation of Python code.


> [!NOTE]  
> This is currently being worked on. It is far from being ready for any kind of release, let alone a stable one.  
> Please wait for the v1 release; before that, this plugin is likely to not work.

| `package`                        | string       | yes      | The name of the package where the generated files will be located                                                                                                                                                         |
| `emit_init_file`                 | bool         | yes      | If set to to `false` there will be no `__init__.py` file created in the package that you specified. Only set this to false if you know that you already have a `__init__.py` file otherwise the generated code wont work. |
| `sql_driver`                     | string       | no       | The name of the sql driver you want to use. Defaults to `aiosqlite`. Valid options are listed [here](#feature-support)                                                                                                    |

| `emit_exact_table_names`         | bool         | no       | If `true`, model names will mirror table names. Otherwise sqlc attempts to singularize plural table names.                                                                                                                |

| `query_parameter_limit`          | integer      | no       | Not yet implemented.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Feature Support
Every [sqlc macro](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/reference/macros.html) is supported.
The supported [query commands](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/reference/query-annotations.html) depend on the SQL driver you are using, supported commands are listed below.
> Every `:batch*` command is not supported by this plugin and probably will never be.

> Prepared Queries are not planned for the near future, but will be implemented sooner or later

> [!NOTE]  
> Asyncpg only has very bad support until now. It doesn't support `:execresult`, `:execrows` and `:execlastid`

|           | `:exec` | `:execresult` | `:execrows` | `:execlastid` | `:many` | `:one` | `:copyfrom` |

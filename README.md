# sqlc-gen-better-python
A WASM plugin for SQLC allowing the generation of Python code.


> [!NOTE]  
> This is currently being worked on. It is far from being ready for any kind of release, let alone a stable one.  
> Please wait for the first GitHub release; before that, this plugin is likely to not work.

## Feature Support
> Every `:batch*` command is not supported by this plugin and probably will never be.

> Prepared Queries are not planned for the near future, but will be implemented sooner or later
